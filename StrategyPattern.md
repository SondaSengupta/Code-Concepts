From Wikipedia:
A strategy pattern is useful when you need to dynamically swap algorithms used in an applciation. That is to say, when there are conditional logic going on, you stash the separate logic for each choice as a seperate class, make them interchangeable and contractual through interfaces to abstract it out, and then have a larger method that will call upon those separate behaviors.
