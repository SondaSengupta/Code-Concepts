### Dictionary Data Structure:
- aka maps or associative arrays
- As well as the data (values), that the dictionary holds, there is also a key that is used for searching and finding the required values. The elements of the dictionary are represented by pairs (key, value), where the key is used for searching.
- for every key, there is a value and the aggregation of these pairs make a dictionary.
