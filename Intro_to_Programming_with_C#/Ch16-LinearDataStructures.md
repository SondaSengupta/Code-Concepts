### Abstract Data Structures
- a **data structure** is an ordered set of data organized based on logical and mathematical expressions, done in order to efficiently complete tasks (adding, removing, sorting, etc.) and save memory space.
- an **abstract data type (adt)** provides the definition of a data structure by defining its operations and properties.

#### Basic Data Structures in Programming
-     Linear – these include lists, stacks and queues
-     Tree-like – different types of trees like binary trees, B-trees and balanced trees
-     Dictionaries – key-value pairs organized in hash tables
-     Sets – unordered bunches of unique elements
-     Others – multi-sets, bags, multi-bags, priority queues, graphs, etc...

### List Data Structures
- **list** is an ordered sequence of elements. A list data structure is arranged consequetively and has a property length, which is a count of the elements within it.
