## What is SOLID?
SOLID is a group of design principles that when combined together provide a good roadmap for effective, maintainable object-oriented code. SOLID stands for:
- **S**: single responsibility principle
- **O**: open-closed principle
- **L**: Liskov substitution principle
- **I**: interface segragation principle
- **D**: dependency injection principle

## Open-Closed Principle
-**definition:** software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. In other words, when you need to modify your software, you should not need to dig through internals to change it. You should be able to add new functions or classes to extend upon the already existing classes and functions. i.e. you don't need to perform chest surgery to put on a coat.
-You can do this by using abstractions through interfaces and abstract base classes. In procedural code, we can add parameters to functions.
