# What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?

Inversion of control, broadly is exactly as it states. When there is a traditionally a relationship between two roles and one is in control of calling and order -- with IoC, the relationship is reversed so the othe role controls calling.

You can see this in callbacks, event-handlers, and dependency injection, the most common form of IoC. It is a technique of  a change made to code, where the control of flow is in the delegate.

Dependency Injection is a particular kind of IoC where instead of the class controlling the details of what it depends within its innards, the control is pushed to the client who passes what the class requires to accept.
